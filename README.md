# Codificador_a_Kapon
This app is meant to be a codifier, it takes any sentence and codifies it. 

The goal of this app is to encrypt phrases so that my girlfriend and I can communicate without anyone else knowing what we're talking about.

I have to say that this is my first application with androidStudio and the first time I also use kotlin. (This is why there are so many if/else instead of switch/cases, and code that does nothing for example).

I plan to do more projects with androidStudio in the future, perhaps even to update the codifier.
